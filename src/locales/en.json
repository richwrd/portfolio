      "p2": "Every line of code, every design decision, and every animation you see here was crafted through careful prompt engineering. I guided the process, refined the outputs, and made sure everything aligned with my vision — but the heavy lifting? That was all AI.",
      "p3": "This whole project was built using <highlight>vibe coding</highlight> — that flow state where you just go with the feeling, iterate on the fly, and let the creative process guide you. No rigid planning, just pure experimentation and refinement until it feels right.",
      "p4": "It's pretty wild what's possible when you combine human creativity with AI capabilities. This site is a testament to that collaboration — showing that with the right prompts, a clear vision, and a good vibe, you can build something truly special.",
